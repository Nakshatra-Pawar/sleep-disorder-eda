# 💤 Sleep Health & Lifestyle EDA

This repository contains a data exploration project that analyzes how lifestyle factors like physical activity, stress level, heart rate, and occupation affect sleep health and disorders.

## 📂 Files

- `sleep_health_analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with complete EDA using pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn.
- `sleep_health_dataset.csv`: Original dataset used for analysis.

## 📊 Project Overview

Using a dataset of 374 individuals, we explored:

- Distribution of sleep duration
- Relationship between stress level and sleep
- Sleep disorders by gender and occupation
- Heart rate patterns across sleep conditions
- Correlation matrix of numerical health indicators

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- Python 🐍
- Pandas
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📌 Key Insights

- People with insomnia and sleep apnea had higher average heart rates.
- Sleep duration is negatively correlated with stress level.
- Females on average sleep more than males.
- Sales occupations showed the highest median stress levels.

## 📚 Dataset

- **Source**: [Health and Sleep Relation 2024 – Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/orvile/health-and-sleep-relation-2024)
- Format: CSV with 13 columns and 374 entries
- Includes: Gender, Age, Occupation, Sleep Duration, Quality of Sleep, Physical Activity Level, Stress Level, BMI Category, Blood Pressure, Heart Rate, Daily Steps, Sleep Disorder

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository  
2. Open `SleepHealthAnalysis.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook  
3. Run the cells to explore data and results

## ✨ Future Work

- Predictive modeling using logistic regression or random forest
- Outlier detection and advanced data cleaning
- Export visualizations as reports or dashboards
